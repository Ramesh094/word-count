Hello good morning,

I am from Andhra Pradesh, Amalapuram.
I completed my graduation in 2018 with electrical and electronics engineering at BVCITS.

My last job role was electrical engineer in a construction company named bsrit. I worked there for 
almost one year.
Where i have to make daily reports on work-progress, labour and consumption of material and 
implementation of electrical drawings etc.
